PetorsAndroidFramework
======================

This repository should always contain the latest version of my Android framework (unless I become lazy). It may also contain random test programs and other stuff, but that's not really important. You are free to use anything from my framework, but I leave no guarantees that it will work, or is implemented in a good way. (Also, if you're in my IT-class and decide to use this for a school project it would be cool if you could clarify that the code is from me. So I don't get accidentally accused of cheating or anything like that, no matter how slim the chance.)
